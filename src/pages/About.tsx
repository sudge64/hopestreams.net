        <h3>Hope Streams</h3>
        <p>
          Founded in 2008, Hope Streams is a family-owned and operated business
          dedicated to producing products which assist people of all ages in
          connecting to The Perfect Parent (the One who makes us healed and
          whole).
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of our products center around empowering parents (and caregivers)
          to love and nurture their children’s spirits so they can know and
          experience God in their hearts, not just their heads. The good news is
          that it’s never too late to start growing the spirit so EACH person
          (parent, child, person) can carry their own portable abundant life
          that the Lord Jesus Christ paid the ultimate price for!

        <p>
          Crystal Wade writes to throw out a lifeline of hope for people to
          receive connectivity to trust the Father and be internally aligned to
          relate to Him, and thus receive His relationship and the blessings
          that naturally flow from Him. She loves to discover the redemptive
          plan of the Father in people, places, and things. She co-authored Pure
          Joy and wrote Perfect Peace together with its audio album, tools for
          healing trust and growing the spirit. She is managing editor of Hope
          Streams.net. Crystal and her husband Stephen share a passion to
          position the next generation to be anchored in truth so they can fly
          in the spirit. To that end, their family launched Let’s Wade In, a
          media portal, which is both a community for children and teens and a
          tool for parents and caregivers to anchor students in truth so they
          can fly in the Spirit. They have three wonderful sons.

        <h3>Our Purpose</h3>
        <p>
          Stephen and Crystal received a commission from the Father to connect
          the generations to Him and to each other so that they can: Start well.
          Live well, Recover well, Build well, and Finish well. As part of that
          commission, they release materials to assist people of all ages in
          connecting to The Perfect Parent. The couple carries the Father's
          passion to position the next generation to be grounded in His truth
          and love so they can fly in the Spirit. To that end, their family
          launched Let’s Wade In, a media portal, which is both a community for
          children, tweens and teens and a tool for parents, grandparents and
          caregivers to anchor students in truth and love so they can fly in the
          Spirit. They have three wonderful sons.
